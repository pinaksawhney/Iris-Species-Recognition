# Iris Species Recognition

## Overview

In this project I utilize the famous [Iris Flower Data Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to classify the Iris flowers into three species - Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. The dataset consists of 150 iris flower samples, each species having 50 samples each. Four features were measured sepal length(in cm), sepal width (in cm), petal length (in cm), petal width (in cm).

## Description

Here, the machine learning Model -  Support vector Machines is implemented.
